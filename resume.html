            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As I reflect on my academic journey, it's fascinating to see how unexpected turns can shape our path. Starting with a background in biology during my 12th grade, I soon discovered a burgeoning interest in business. It was this curiosity that led me to choose BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) as my degree. The blend of technology and business principles felt like the perfect fit—a bridge between my analytical mind and entrepreneurial aspirations. Now, as I continue my studies at Code Quotient School of Technology, I eagerly explore programming, databases, and web development. Who knew that my biology roots would eventually intertwine with lines of code and digital solutions! </p>
